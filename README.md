universal powered guidance in Kerbal Space Program based on krpc

## 1. About UPG

Universal Powered Guidance is a versatile powered guidance developed by Lu, et al. [1-3] , which is based on optimal control theory.

By setting different constraints, the algorithms can be used for differnet purpose including landing, ascent, etc. Here only the powered descent is implemented.
